Like Xenogears, you also pilot mechs though they are less important in this game, and are more a background theme than being the focus. Music was done by Yasunori Mitsuda and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and it definitely shows. While much of the game is just ambient sounds, whenever the music does take over it brings with it the magic of what a truly well-composed and performed orchestrated soundtrack can do for a game. The graphics are well done, and animated very smoothly and the effects during battles are very pretty. Being a little older than some recent RPG's (Was released over a year ago in Japan and the translation took forever) the graphics seem slightly dated but they are still beautiful.
And now the bad news: For me this game possesses only one flaw in that the English dubbing of it is only average, sounding like a dubbed anime. Many characters are over acting and it pains me to see this in such a quality RPG. It doesn't help that during the cut scenes the dialogue is subtitled right along with the actors speaking the same language which would be fine if they sounded better, but since they don't it's annoying to read it before they say it, and hear them say it with forced emotion or non at all. It is a minor flaw in a near flawless RPG. The other concern is the editing. There is one cut scene that was altered and it only involves the placement of a hand. Nothing to worry about.
