First off, with the title I gave this, why not a 5/5? All the hardcore pros claim that with a good fight stick you can't go wrong. Although I've never had a fight stick of any kind, some minor issues I've had with this pad have claimed not to exist with quality sticks.
Personally, I don't think a fight stick is right for me. I'm almost 22, I've been playing Capcom fighters since SF II; during this time I've always used my left thumb for the directional commands and I don't want that to change. The D-pad on the 360 controller is trash and the analog stick is much better, BUT the SF IV Fightpad is better than the analog stick. I can EX cancel in my combos like a beast with the Fightpad which is essential if you wanna play advanced with fire ball characters like Ryu or Sagat. Also, the turbo function can be very useful if applied properly.
I main Balrog, Fei Long and Ryu. I couldn't play as well with 360 controller as I can now with the pad. Turbo has been argued to be an unfair advantage in fighting games, but it isn't software hax PLUS it's officially licensed. Turboing Balrog hurts more than it helps except of light kick from my experience, but with Fei and Ryu everything should be turboed except the grab buttons.
A problem I had with this Fightpad with SF IV is that when I tried to do normal special moves or advanced combos, if my EX bar was full I'd sometimes do SUPERS unexpectedly. There was one hard challenge mode trial for Sagat that didn't involve doing a SUPER or Ultra at all, but when I did the Tiger Knee in the 4th hard trial a super would come out. You wanna do moves fast, but be aware that doing them too fast could do accidental supers. Although this can get annoying when it happens, it's still much better than the interface on the 360 controller, which is not meant for fighting games like this.
If you're gonna take this game seriously, you need this product or a stick. Think about the games you have already, you may find more use for this corded controller with Turbo than just SF IV. I'm sure gonna be using this for Marvel vs Capcom 2 which should be released on XBL and PSN THIS WEEK; this will work better with all Capcom fighting games than the 360 controller. There is a switch on the back so you can set the pad to be either a D-pad, left analog stick or right analog stick. You can't play this with shooters like Halo, but no doubt there should be other games you can use it for.
IDK what the price of this is now, but don't pay the scalper price. You shouldn't have to pay more than what a wireless 360 controller is at retail price. There have been scarcity problems with this product, but don't pay 3 figures for it. I hope you find one at a reasonable price like I did.
Not that it has much to do with the quality and functionality of the product, but I picked the Chun-Li because I wanted a cute anime girl on my controller instead of the shoto scrubs looking stupid; the Blanka one looked really ugly. Blue is also my favorite color.
quality essential better useful advantage seriously reasonable cute favorite
minor issues trash problem unexpected annoying scarcity ugly
